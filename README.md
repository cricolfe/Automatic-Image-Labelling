# Automatic-Image-Labelling
The aim of this toolbox is to label images automatically. Images are captured under controlled background and objects are labelled easily using 2D computer vision techniques. Afterwards detected objects are combined with images of standard backgrounds to create a rich image set to train deep models. Results are ready to train a deep learning model using Tensorflow.
